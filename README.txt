Description: the goal of the project is to implement the segmentation of pip2-enriched domains in the C. elegans early embryo. The project was initialised by Alessandro Ulivi at IGBMC (Illkirch, France), the initial focus is on the segmentation of time-lapse data, with a specific focus on colocalization analyses.

Dependencies: The pip2_segmentation.yml allows to create an environment with all the dependencies to run the scripts. The present package versions were used to establish the pipeline:
- python 3.12.4
- jupyterlab 4.2.3
- pip 24.0
- numpy 2.0.0
