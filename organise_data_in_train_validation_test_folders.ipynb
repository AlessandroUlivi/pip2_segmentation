    "Description: the notebook was written to split time-lapse files (each file is a 3D array with dimensions TYX) of pip2-enriched domain dynamics and corresponding manually annotated binary segmentation masks (each mask is a 3D array with dimensions TYX). The notebook splits each individual time-lapse file and the corresponding segmentation mask into individual time-points (2D array of dimension YX obtained by splitting the intial time-lapse along the T axis). After splitting, the names of the time-point and of the corresponding segmentaion mask match. Raw time-points and segmentation masks are saved in separate folders.\n",
    "In addition, two percentages of the files (raw time-points and corresponing segmentation masks) are saved in a two different directories, to be used as, respectively, validation and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-lapse files have been obtained by imaging live at a Nikon CSU-X1 Spinning disk microscope the C. elegans early embryo (1-6 cells stage) using a 100x, 1.4NA, oil immersion objective (xy pixel size 0.11 um). The labelling of pip2-enriched domains is obtained using of the ACR074 C.elegans strain expressing mCherry fused with a PIP2 binding-domain.\n",

    "NOTE: raw time-lapse files in input_folder are not the actual raw images. They went through a pre-processing process involving the reorganization of the actual raw files into individual time-lapse files. During this reorganization matadata were lost.\n",
    "NOTE 2 (2024/09/04): the split between train and test datasets is done, for the moment, by selecting, randomly, a certain number of samples (variable test_fraction), and using them as test dataset. An alternative method could have been to randomly select a fraction of timepoint per each sample. However I fear that by doing this some data leaking might happen as timepoints are not independent, in fact, a high correlation is expected (e.g. the emrbyo is usually positioned in the center of the field of view and does not move) and the closer the timepoints, the higher their correlation."
