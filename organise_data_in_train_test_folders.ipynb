    "Description: the notebook was written to split time-lapse images of pip2-enrich domains dynamics in the early C. elegans development saved as individual files with corresponding manually annotated binary segmentation masks, into individual time-points with names matching between raw files and corresponding segmentation ground truths. Raw files and segmentation masks are saved in separate folders. In addition, a percentage of the files is saved in a different directory, to be used as validation dataset.\n",

    "As files within \"sample_X\" folders are pooled in the output folders, the names of the raw_files and labelled binary masks are expected to be different between different \"sample_X\" folders.\n",

    "NOTE: raw_files in input_folder are not the actual raw images. They when to pre-processing involving the reorganization of the actual raw files into individual time-lapse images. During this reorganization matadata were lost.\n",
    "NOTE 2 (2024/09/04): the split between train and validation datasets is done, for the moment, by selecting, randomly, a certain number of samples (variable test_fraction), and using them as validation dataset. An alternative method could have been to randomly select a fraction of timepoint per each sample. However I fear that by doing this some data leaking might happen as timepoints are not independent, in fact, a high correlation is expected (e.g. the emrbyo is usually positioned in the center of the field of view and does not move) and the closer the timepoints, the higher their correlation.
